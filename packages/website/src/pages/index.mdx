## join

made a personal website? part of hack club? dm
{/* prettier-ignore */} <a href="https://hackclub.enterprise.slack.com/team/U09D42Q0ARJ" class="handle">@gideon</a> to get added!

you should include:

- your preferred name or username
- a link to your amazing personal website
- an 88x31 button! either as an image, or a link to it hosted on your website

don't have a button yet? make one! you can use a design tool like [Figma](https://figma.com), a pixel art editor like
[Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/), or generate one online, for example [here](https://hekate2.github.io/buttonmaker/)
or [here](http://88x31.datakra.sh/). make sure it's an image 88px wide and 31px tall, and remember to be
creative!

## include

next you want to include the webring on your personal website! it's
super easy, just add this script tag to the very end of your website's
body:

```js
<script src="https://pagering.gideon.sh/embed.js" defer></script>
```

then, wherever you want the webring link to appear in your page, add:

```html
<pagering-link></pagering-link>
```

<Image
  src={linkScreenshot}
  alt="screenshot of the webring link, light background"
/>

there are also some extra options you can configure:

- **theme:** the colour of the link - if your website always has a light or dark background, set this to
  'light' or 'dark'
  <small>"light" | "dark" | "system" (default: system)</small>
- **class/style:** add spacing, positioning, or other styles

```html
<!-- for example -->
<pagering-link theme="dark" style="margin-top: 8px"></pagering-link>
```

<Image
  src={linkScreenshotDark}
  alt="screenshot of the webring link, dark background"
/>
